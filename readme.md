# James's JS Playground
This is where I test out the performance of various concepts, algos and data-structures in JS.
Mostly out of curiosity and ideally to have a better understanding of the language and comp sci so that I can be a better SWE.

It's also where I might use it to quickly run some random code as an alternative to using JSFiddle or some other online playground.
